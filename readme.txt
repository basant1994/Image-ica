# Image-ica - The Photo Editor

Image-ica is a Python based offline and lightweight photo viewer and editor

## Motivation

There are many factors which guided us to reach a unanimous decision of
building a photo editor software from the scratch. The few of the reasons are
listed as follows.
1. Many photo editors available online and required internet connection for
whole period.
2. Many features are for the licensed version only and support only basic
operation in free version.
3. Not a single software provides all these operations.
The basic feature which are included in the software are also mentioned
below.
1. Zooming
2. Rotation
3. Flipping
4. Gray-Scaling
5. Viewing
After the development of basic features, there were some opportunities
to develop some advance feature which will provide the uniqueness in the
project. Building architecture independent software was one of the topic priority
of the project. The advance feature is also mentioned below.
1. 1-click Encryption and Decryption
2. Color Pop
3. Fast and Powerful Filters (Sepia,Negative,Black & White)
4. Histogram ( R, G & B)
